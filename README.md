# cpp-matrix-library
 A quick cpp matrix math library intended for ML use. It is a quick matrix library that i created for basic linear algebra applications.
 Matrices and vectors are all unified as one matrix class (vectors are column matrices). There is also a public thread pool class (it comes free and baked in! can you believe it!); this is used internally to speed up some matrix operations. 

 ## get started
 just include the `matrix.h` header in your project! 
 Everything is contained inside a `Math` namespace

 ## future improvements (if i rmb...)
 - implement better matrix operation algorithms
 - consider specialized cases with sparse matrices
 - general optimizations and improvements...
